Components
----------
Refer your project for many types of components 
ng generate component header  
ng g c header (shorthand command)
ng g c footer -it -is    (componenent with inline template and inline styles )
ng g c nav -is           (componenent with inline style )
ng g c header/search --flat -is -it  (componenent without folder. called as flat component. with -is -it also)
--flat -> for folder less component -is -> for --inline-style -it -> for --inline-template

The above types of components we have created in the project.

    Various method of operators, you can chain on Observables to filter data, sort and do many things over the observable data
